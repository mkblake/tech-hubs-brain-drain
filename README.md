# Tech Hubs and Brain Drain - Across the United States

## Project Summary
This capstone project maps the emergence of technology hubs across the United States from 2000 to 2017, and investigates the relationship between the growth of tech hubs and the phenomenon known as “brain drain” across the United States. 

## Motivation
As a Nashville resident since 2010, I have witnessed the city’s enormous growth over the past decade. In recent years, Nashville has seen [impressive job growth](https://mtsunews.com/state-of-middle-tennessee-tech-report-2020/) in the technology sector. [Oracle bringing 8,500 jobs](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/oracle-plans-1-2-billion-campus-in-nashville-creating-8-500-jobs-01618437488) to Nashville in the next decade will likely solidify Nashville as a tech hub for years to come. While states like Tennessee have enjoyed the growth of one or more metropolitan statistical areas (hereafter referred to as MSAs) as "tech hubs," other states are experiencing a brain drain. How have cities and states across the country fared in the last 20 years?

## Definitions
I have defined a **Tech Hub** as the clustering of technology jobs in a particular MSA. For example, the Nashville Metropolitan Area is defined in this dataset as the Nashville-Davidson-Murfreesboro-Franklin, TN MSA.

**Brain Gain** occurs when states "are keeping and receiving a greater share of [highly educated] adults than they used to."  citation needed: https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/republicans/2019/4/losing-our-minds-brain-drain-across-the-united-states

**Brain Drain** occurs when states are "hemorrahging their homegrown talent and failing to attract out-of-staters who are highly educated." citation needed: https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/republicans/2019/4/losing-our-minds-brain-drain-across-the-united-states

**Highly Educated** indicates an adult between the ages of 31 and 40 who resides in the top third of the national education distribution. 

## Data Questions
* In a given state, is there an overall relationship between brain drain and tech hubs?
* Is it possible for a tech hub to emerge over time in a state despite documented brain drain from that state?
* Is there a correlation between the emergence of a tech hub in one state and a brain drain in neighboring states? 
* Do states that “grow” tech hubs experience less brain drain overall? 


## Data Sources
The source data was obtained from the Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics Report, published by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, United States Department of Labor. The following Standard Occupational Classification Codes (SOC Codes) are represented in this data:
